# TombEngine 

In 2000, Core gave us a great gift of a level editor where people can create their own custom levels based on TR4.
Over the decades, the engine was upgraded massively via TREP and TRNG:
TREP (Tomb Raider Engine Patcher) is a tool that allows you to modify the exe to expand certain limits and implement new features.
TRNG builds upon TREP and gives a lot of new features including its own scripting language and even more extended limits.

However, TRNG is a closed-source and essentially an abandonware. No one is able to fix well-known bugs in TRNG and implement new features, 
although you can still implement with plugin (with C++ knowledge) however it is not user-friendly (you need to know C++) and it is poorly documented.

TEN (TombEngine) is supposed to be a new engine which is (most importantly) open-source, removes limits, and fixes bugs from the original game,
it also provides support for Lua (a programming language), all objects from TR1-5, and many more exciting features and gameplay functionalities such as: corner shimmying or enlarged 2D map (where you can build a massive level).
